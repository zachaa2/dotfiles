# dotfiles

Some personal dotfiles and other assets + resources I used. Configs and other resources should be compatible across common linux distros.

## Layout

- `zsh/`
  Zsh config

- `git/`
  Git config

- `config/`
  App configs usually under `~/.config/`

- `assets/wallpapers/`
  Some wallpapers I've used

- `docs/`
  Some key references and lists:
    - `themes-and-icons.md` themes and icons used and where to find them 
    - `vscode-extensions.txt` vscode extensions list
